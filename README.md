# QtAppImageUpdateExample

This is a simple demonstration application. If `AppImageUpdate` is on the `$PATH` and if this application is running from within an AppImage (`$APPIMAGE` is set), then it offers the option to update itself from the menu.

Note that you can put an AppImage of AppImageUpdate inside the AppImage for this application.

The result is similar to https://sparkle-project.org/ for macOS but this works with AppImageUpdate for Linux.
