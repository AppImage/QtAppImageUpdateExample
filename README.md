# QtAppImageUpdateExample

This is a simple demonstration application. If `AppImageUpdate` is on the `$PATH` and if this application is running from within an AppImage (`$APPIMAGE` is set), then it offers the option to update itself from the menu.

Note that you can put an AppImage of AppImageUpdate inside the AppImage for this application.
